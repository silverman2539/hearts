Your eyes are so pretty
Your hair always looks so nice
Your smile is gorgeous
You look hot in chokers
You look so hot in all black
You look so hot in button up shirts
It's so cute when you act like a child
It's adorable when you pretend to be mad
It's adorable when you make a fake sad face
When you play guitar it's cute but also hot
When you aren't fully clothed you look perfect
You're cute when you talk to Pete like he understands you
Your voice is nice
Your voice is extra cute when you're trying to make me feel better
It's cute when you text but you type as if you're saying words like a child
It's cute when you act scared
You're cute when you're nervous
You're cute when you're falling asleep
Everything about you is cute
You're so hot
Every part of your body is gorgeous
You were absolutely adorable as a child
Even your nose is cute
You have nice lips
It's cute when you're sad and I feel like I maybe shouldn't find that cute but it's cute and then I can make you feel better
I like watching you draw because you always look cute
Pictures of us are so cute
You look hot when you're on top of me
I really liked how your hair looked when we went to pride
It's so cute when you play guitar and then you like start singing whatever song you're playing
You're gonna look very good with green hair
Your puppy is cute
Your bunny is cute
You have nice tits
You have a nice ass
The ring I gave you looks good on your finger
You look extra good when you hold my hand
You look amazing when you're in my arms
It's cute when you hang out with my brothers
I don't know why but I always think it's so cute when you're like cutting up your cheese to put on crackers
It's cute when you call me princess
It's kind of cute when you mock me but only kind only kind of cute
