The way I feel when I'm with you
The way you treat my brothers
How cute you are
You buy me lots of stuff
You're nice to cuddle
You're nice to me
You make me feel like I deserve good things
You always seem to care about me doing what's best for me
You don't make me feel stupid when I need help
You're funny but not the mean kind of funny
You are so fucking weird
You're so good at kissing
You have cute pets
You're warm which is helpful when I'm cold
You're only a little taller than me (when I wear heels)
You're perfect
